# 💼 Remote Job Listings Scraper

This Python-based web scraping project automatically collects **remote full-stack programming jobs** from [WeWorkRemotely.com](https://weworkremotely.com). It extracts key job details like title, company, job type, location, posting date, and application deadline, and saves the results in a structured Excel file.

This scraper is part of my **Upwork portfolio** and showcases my skills in **web scraping**, **data parsing**, and **automation scripting using Python**.
